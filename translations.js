    privacy_sharing: 'We do not sell or rent your personally identifying information. We may share information when necessary—for example, to comply with law, to protect rights and safety, with service providers who act on our behalf under confidentiality, and with advertising partners to serve and measure ads (who may process information under their own privacy policies). We do not share your information with third parties for their marketing unrelated to providing ads in the app.',
    privacy_rights: 'You can ask us what data we hold about you, request correction or deletion where applicable, and object to or restrict certain processing. You may also withdraw consent where we rely on it. Refusing or limiting data may affect some features of the app.',

Our total liability in connection with this policy or the service shall not exceed the amount you paid us, if any, in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or one hundred Indian Rupees (₹100), whichever is greater.
